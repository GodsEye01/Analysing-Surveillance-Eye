
There are three different types of IPv6 addresses:


Unicast


A packet sent to a unicast address arrives at the interface belonging to the address.

Anycast


These addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast addresses but they address a group of interfaces. The packet destined for an anycast address will arrive at the nearest router interface. Anycast addresses are only used by routers.

Multicast


These addresses identify a group of interfaces. A packet destined for a multicast address will arrive at all interfaces belonging to the multicast group. The IPv4 broadcast address, usually xxx.xxx.xxx.255, is expressed by multicast addresses in IPv6.

When IPv6 is enabled on a server, there may be a need to enable IPv4 mapped IPv6 address communication. 
This compatibility option allows for IPv4 addresses to be represented as IPv6 addresses. 
Permitting IPv6 applications to communicate with IPv4 and vice versa may be a security issue.

This option may not be required in most cases and is available only for compatibility. 
This option will allow IPv6-only applications to work with IPv4 in a dual stack environment. 
This is most useful for third party applications which may not support an IPv6-only environment. 
To enable this feature, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

Configuring IPv6

To configure a FreeBSD system as an IPv6 client, add these two lines to rc.conf:
ifconfig_rl0_ipv6="inet6 accept_rtadv"
rtsold_enable="YES"

The first line enables the specified interface to receive router solicitation messages. The second line enables the router solicitation daemon, rtsol(8).

If the interface needs a statically assigned IPv6 address, add an entry to specify the static address and associated prefix length:
ifconfig_rl0_ipv6="inet6 2001:db8:4672:6565:2026:5043:2d42:5344 prefixlen 64"

To assign a default router, specify its address:
ipv6_defaultrouter="2001:db8:4672:6565::1"
